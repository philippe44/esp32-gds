# esp32-gds
Graphic Library for ESP32

More to come, but big thank you to https://github.com/TaraHoleInIt/tarablessd1306 where most things come from.

I've changed a few things, added JPEG management and added a small framework to easily add other drivers independently

So far I've added SSD1326, SSD1327 and SH1106 plus SSD1675 (eInk)
